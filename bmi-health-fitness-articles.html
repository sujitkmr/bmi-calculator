    <div class="topic">
      <h3>What is BMI and Why Does it Matter?</h3>
      <p>
        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using a person‚Äôs height and weight to estimate body fat levels. 
        Although it doesn‚Äôt measure body composition directly, BMI has been used for decades as a reliable indicator of 
        whether someone falls into the underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese category. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason BMI matters is because excess weight is strongly linked to chronic conditions such as diabetes, 
        cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Conversely, being underweight may increase the risk of osteoporosis, 
        anemia, and poor immunity. In short, BMI provides a quick ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of overall health risks, making it a useful 
        screening tool for both doctors and individuals monitoring their health.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>How to Calculate BMI: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
      <p>
        Calculating BMI is straightforward: take your weight in kilograms and divide it by your height in meters squared. 
        For example, if you weigh 70 kg and are 1.75 m tall, the calculation would be: 
        <strong>70 √∑ (1.75 √ó 1.75) = 22.9</strong>, which falls into the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many online calculators, including the one on gymbmi.com, can do this instantly, but it‚Äôs helpful to understand 
        the formula. It‚Äôs also worth noting that for children and teenagers, BMI is interpreted differently using 
        percentile charts, since their bodies are still developing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>BMI Ranges Explained</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding the ranges is key: 
        <strong>Underweight (&lt;18.5)</strong>, <strong>Normal (18.5‚Äì24.9)</strong>, 
        <strong>Overweight (25‚Äì29.9)</strong>, and <strong>Obese (30+)</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These ranges provide a quick framework for assessing health, but they should not be the only measure you rely on. 
        Two people with the same BMI might have very different health risks depending on muscle mass, body fat distribution, 
        and lifestyle factors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>BMI vs Body Fat Percentage</h3>
      <p>
        While BMI is useful for population-level screening, it doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. 
        Body fat percentage, measured using calipers, bioelectrical impedance, or DEXA scans, gives a more precise 
        measurement of how much of your weight comes from fat versus muscle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For athletes or people with high muscle mass, BMI may overestimate fat levels. 
        On the other hand, someone with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù BMI could still have high visceral fat, which poses health risks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
      <p>
        BMI is not a perfect tool. It doesn‚Äôt account for differences in sex, age, ethnicity, or muscle mass. 
        For example, older adults often lose muscle and gain fat, but their BMI may not change significantly. 
        Similarly, athletes with a lot of muscle may be classified as overweight, even though they are very healthy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, BMI remains useful when interpreted alongside other metrics such as waist circumference, 
        blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

      <h3>Best Exercises for Each BMI Category</h3>
      <p>
        Exercise recommendations can vary depending on your BMI. 
        Underweight individuals may benefit from resistance training to build muscle, 
        while those who are overweight or obese may see the most benefits from low-impact cardio activities like 
        walking, swimming, or cycling. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A balanced approach combining strength, cardio, and flexibility ensures the best long-term health outcomes.

    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Simple Home Workouts for Beginners</h3>
      <p>
        Staying active doesn‚Äôt always require a gym membership. Push-ups, bodyweight squats, planks, and 
        yoga poses can all be done at home with no equipment. Start small ‚Äî even 15 minutes a day of consistent 
        activity can bring noticeable changes in energy levels and mood within weeks. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Cardio vs Strength Training</h3>
      <p>
        Both forms of exercise are important. Cardio helps burn calories and improve heart health, 
        while strength training builds muscle that boosts your resting metabolism. 
        Ideally, adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate cardio and 2‚Äì3 strength training sessions weekly. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>How to Stay Active with a Busy Schedule</h3>
      <p>
        Time is one of the biggest barriers to fitness. But activity can be integrated into your lifestyle ‚Äî 
        take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or cycle to nearby destinations, and use short ‚Äúmovement breaks‚Äù 
        during work hours. Even 5‚Äì10 minutes of stretching or walking can refresh your body and mind. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Benefits of Walking Daily for 30 Minutes</h3>
      <p>
        Walking is often underestimated, yet it‚Äôs one of the most effective low-impact exercises. 
        Just 30 minutes a day helps lower blood pressure, improves mood, enhances digestion, and keeps joints flexible. 
        Over time, this simple habit can reduce the risk of chronic diseases significantly.

      <h3>Healthy Eating Habits to Maintain Normal BMI</h3>
      <p>
        A balanced diet is the foundation of good health. Focus on whole foods like vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, 
        whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit processed snacks and sugary drinks. 
        Eating slowly, staying hydrated, and planning meals ahead of time are simple habits that support 
        maintaining a healthy BMI long term.

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Top 10 Foods for Weight Loss</h3>
      <p>
        Oats, eggs, leafy greens, lean meats, berries, legumes, nuts, seeds, yogurt, and avocados are nutrient-dense foods 
        that keep you full while providing essential vitamins. These foods help reduce overeating and maintain energy 
        levels throughout the day.

    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>High-Calorie Foods for Healthy Weight Gain</h3>
      <p>
        For those looking to gain weight, focus on calorie-dense but nutritious foods like nuts, avocados, full-fat dairy, 
        and olive oil. Pairing these with strength training ensures the added weight comes in the form of muscle rather 
        than fat.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Understanding Portion Control</h3>
      <p>
        Overeating is one of the leading contributors to weight gain. Using smaller plates, serving appropriate portions, 
        and eating mindfully (without distractions) can help manage calorie intake. Learning to listen to hunger and 
        fullness cues is essential for long-term success.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Importance of Hydration</h3>
      <p>
        Water is vital for nearly every process in the body. Proper hydration helps with digestion, regulates temperature, 
        reduces overeating, and supports metabolism. A good rule of thumb is to drink water regularly throughout the day, 
        especially before meals and after physical activity.

      <h3>BMI for Children & Teenagers</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike adults, BMI for children and teenagers is measured using growth charts that take into account age and sex. 
        A child at the 85th percentile may be considered overweight, while one below the 5th percentile may be 
        underweight. Monitoring BMI during these years helps ensure healthy development.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>BMI During Pregnancy</h3>
      <p>
        Pregnancy brings natural weight gain, but BMI still plays a role in monitoring maternal health. 
        Women with higher pre-pregnancy BMI may be advised to gain less weight during pregnancy, 
        while underweight women may need additional calories to support both mother and baby.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>How Stress Affects Weight & BMI</h3>
      <p>
        Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that increases appetite and cravings for high-calorie foods. 
        Chronic stress can lead to weight gain around the abdomen, which carries higher health risks. 
        Managing stress through exercise, meditation, or proper sleep is key.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Myths About BMI & Fitness</h3>
      <p>
        A common myth is that BMI is ‚Äúuseless‚Äù ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt true. While it has limitations, 
        it remains an affordable and accessible screening tool. Another misconception is that 
        being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù BMI guarantees health. In reality, lifestyle habits matter more than the number alone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h3>Health Risks of Being Overweight or Underweight</h3>
      <p>
        Both extremes pose risks. Being overweight increases the chances of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, 
        and certain cancers. Being underweight, on the other hand, can lead to weakened immunity, osteoporosis, 
        and fertility issues. The goal is balance ‚Äî maintaining a BMI within the healthy range while focusing on 
        long-term wellness.
